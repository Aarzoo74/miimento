    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>Late one night, while taking a break from my MBA entrance studies, I (Tej) stopped by a small tea stall for a cup of chai. There, in an unexpected twist of fate, I ran into my old school PT teacher. After almost a decade, we were reuniting, reliving the golden memories of school days.
        As we talked, he said something that struck a chord:
        "Aaj kal ke students mein wo spark nahi dikhta... na career ke liye, na kisi goal ke liye."
        His words stayed with me. That night, I couldn’t stop thinking—why was this happening?
        I started digging deeper, going through research, my personal experiences, and conversations with students. A pattern emerged: students from tier 2/3 cities and villages often lack access to proper guidance and mentorship. They rely heavily on parents, teachers, and limited local resources, often unaware of career paths beyond the conventional STEM and government job options. Many capable students end up making career decisions based on herd mentality rather than informed choices.
        That’s when an idea sparked in my mind: What if we could connect students with their alumni—people who once stood in their shoes and have now walked diverse career paths?
        I shared this vision with Aarzoo and Deep, and together, we started shaping it into reality. The more we brainstormed, the clearer it became—this was more than just a networking platform; it was a bridge between aspirations and possibilities.
        And that’s how MiiMento was born—built on the core pillars of Guidance, Mentorship, and Networking.
        Today, MiiMento is designed to empower students by providing exposure to unconventional career paths, real-life success and failure stories, and meaningful mentor connections. Our hybrid mentorship model ensures students get structured guidance while maintaining the privacy and convenience of mentors.
        But we’re not stopping there. We’re integrating technology to make mentorship more accessible, scalable, and impactful. Our long-term vision is to bring MiiMento to every school, hostel, and community where students need direction and exposure to real career possibilities.
        Because at the end of the day, one right conversation with the right mentor can change a student's life.
        And that’s exactly what we’re here to do.</p>
